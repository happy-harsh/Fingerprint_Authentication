# Fingerprint_Authentication
The proposed  fingerprint identification system consists of different phases, namely:-1. Fingerprint Liveliness 2. Fingerprint acquisition, 2. Finger markup & matching.
Images can be acquired through a control capture device such as a scanner or a fixed focus camera. The image acquisition provides a perceived dpi (dots per inch) measurement to adjust the image resolution. 
The image dpi captured using a live-scanner is different from the image which is collected.
 Pre-processing of the fingerprints including reconstruction (Direct denoise the fingerprints and reconstruct the missing ridge structure without explicitly estimating the orientation field using GAN’s and CNN-based fingerprint reconstruction from the corrupted image)
 Fingerprint feature extraction, is the further step.
The last step is fingerprint matching from the database.
