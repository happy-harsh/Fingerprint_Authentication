- After uploading the image that image with other details of user can be stored in database so that a new user gets registered in the system in this way 

- If the user  is an existing user user may signin in system by capturing fingerprint and unique Employee id given to the user

- The Fingerprint Image captured by user while signin is used to match it with the image of fingerprint registered with user id in the database
